aws
===
EC2:Elastic compute cloud
-------------------------
ec2 is a web service that provides secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
ec2 is a virtual machine that allows you to create and run the applications.

S3:
===
simple storage service 
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. 
An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file.
s3 buckets are public cloud storage containers for objects storage.
using amazon s3 we can store and retrive any kind of data anytime anywhere.
pay how much you can use.

vpc
===
virtual private cloud

vpc creates a logical isolated area in the cloud.
A VPC allows you to secure your virtual networking environment, including your IP addresses,
subnets and network gateways.

subnet:
------
subnet means gives a ranges of ip address
2 types of subnets
1.public subnet
2.private subnet

1.public subnet: public subnet is a subnet that is associated with route table that has a route 
to internet gateway. this entire process is connect with vpc

2.private subnet:  is a subnet that is associated with route table that has not connected 
to internet gateway. this entire process is connect with vpc.
 
{private subnet is to achieve by using NAT gatway.}

{IGW instances allows public ip address to access the internet
NAT GW instances allows no public ip address to access the internet}

AutoScalling
============
AutoScalling is a service provided by aws. autoscalling helps the user to monitor the aws
resources and adjust the capacity.


ELB:
====
Elastic load balancing
----------------------
ELB in the name itself balancing the load 
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets,
types of ELB
------------
1)application load balancer:A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. 
Clients send requests to the load balancer, and the load balancer sends them to targets,
2)network load balancer:The Network Load Balancing (NLB) feature distributes traffic across
several servers by using the TCP/IP networking protocol.
3)classic load balancer:

Route53:
========
Extension of DNS service.
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises.
AWS Route 53 translates URL names, such as www.wordpress.com, into their corresponding 
numeric IP addressesâ€”in this example, 198.143.164.252.

To achieve route53 by using functonalities
1)Domain name registration
2)Routing policy
3)Health checking
1)Domain registration:aws allows users to register for domain names (urls) like .com, .net, .io;
2)The simplest and most common routing type, this policy merely uses AWS Route 53 to map 
your site name to your IP.
3)AWS Route 53 conducts health checks and monitors the health and performance of applications

DNS:
====
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to
machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).
